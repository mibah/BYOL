Steps involved
Load the sample images and preprocess them for use in the BYOL model.
Define the BYOL model architecture, which typically consists of a backbone network (such as ResNet) and a projection network.
Define the training loop, which consists of alternating between training the predictor network and updating the target network using a momentum update rule.
Train the BYOL model on the sample images.
Load a test image and preprocess it for use in the BYOL model.
Compute the representations of the test image using the BYOL model.
Compute the representations of the sample images using the BYOL model.
Compute the cosine similarities between the representation of the test image and the representations of the sample images.
Rank the sample images based on their similarity to the test image and print out the top 3.

byol_model = nn.Sequential(backbone, predictor)

# Compute the representations of the test image and the sample images
test_image = transform(Image.open("test_image.jpg"))

'''
To complete the remaining steps and rank the sample images based on their 
similarity to the test image, you can use the cosine_similarity function 
from the torch.nn.functional module:
'''
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Compute the cosine similarities between the test representation and the sample representations
similarities = [F.cosine_similarity(test_rep, rep, dim=1) for rep in sample_reps]

# Rank the sample images based on their similarity to the test image
ranked_images = sorted(zip(sample_images, similarities), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:3]

# Print out the ranked images
for i, (im, sim) in enumerate(ranked_images):
    print(f"Rank {i+1}: Similarity {sim.item()}")
    im.show()
